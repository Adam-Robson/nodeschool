# NODESCHOOL

## Description

This repository is a collection of continuous learning workshops that
are available at [nodeschool](nodeschool.io). Each workshop is a modular
CLI program, prepared to walk through a set of lessons on the given topic.

For each lesson, the learner attempts a solution and runs it in comparison with
the test. The solution will either pass or fail, allowing either the workshop
or further reading to continue until a solution does pass in alignment
with the test.

These are a simple & elegant, effective format. I am grateful for them.
